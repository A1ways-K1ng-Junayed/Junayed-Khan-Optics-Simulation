# Junâyed Khân Optics Simulation

A simple **Geometric Optics Simulation** built with React + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion. 

You can experiment with:
- Different objects (➡️ Arrow, 🦊 Fox, 🐐 Goat)
- Change object distance (u)
- Change focal length (f)
- See real-time image formation using the lens equation (1/f = 1/v + 1/u)
